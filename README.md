> Our Car Search Website is a dynamic and user-friendly frontend project built using React. This project was motivated by the need to simplify the process of finding the perfect car for potential buyers and car enthusiasts. We recognized that buying a car can be a daunting task, given the myriad of options available in today's automotive market. To address this, we set out to create a user-centric solution that streamlines the car search process.


## Install

```sh
Note: Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install Required Dependencies (Client):
Navigate to the project's client directory by using the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd client
Inside the client directory, install the required dependencies using npm:

Copy code
npm install
Install Yarn:
If you haven't already installed Yarn, you can do so by running:

Copy code
npm install -g yarn
Run the Development Server (Client):
While still in the client directory, start the development server using Yarn:

arduino
Copy code
yarn run dev
Install Required Dependencies (API):
Open another terminal window or tab and navigate to the project's API directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../api
Inside the API directory, install the required dependencies using npm:

Copy code
npm install
Run the API Server (Node.js):
In the same terminal window where you are in the API directory, start the server using nodemon:

Copy code
nodemon index.js
Access the Website:
Once the client and API servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:3000/page
You should now be able to access and use the Car Search Website on your local machine.

Remember to keep both the client and API servers running while you use the website. If you encounter any issues, double-check that you've followed these steps correctly and that all dependencies are properly installed.
```
